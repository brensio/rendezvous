# Rendezvous
 
## Introduction

Rendezvous is a 2D game of the genre Battle Royale made in Java with the help of the LibGDX framework. The player has to survive on an island with dozens of bots, competing against each other over resources and in shrinking zones.

The game was influenced by a number of wonderful games. For example, the type of projection, position (top down) and camera movement (that follows the cursor) resembles that of Hotline Miami. Many concepts of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, one of the most popular of the genre, were also adopted. In fact, the military-focused theme arose from that game. The HUD had some influence on how straightforward this element is in Fortnite. Finally, the art of Rendezvous aims at the simplicity of Minecraft graphics.
