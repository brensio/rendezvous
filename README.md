# Rendezvous
 
## Introduction

Rendezvous is a 2D game of the genre Battle Royale made in Java with the help of the LibGDX framework. The player has to survive on an island with dozens of bots, competing against each other over resources and in smaller and smaller combat zones.

The game was influenced by a number of wonderful games. For example, the camera's projection, position (top down) and movement (that follows the cursor) resembles that of Hotline Miami. Many concepts of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, one of the most popular of the genre, were also adopted. In fact, the military-focused theme arose from that game. The HUD had some influence on how straightforward this element is in Fortnite. Finally, the art of Rendezvous aims at the simplicity of Minecraft graphics.

## How to play

Once you start the game, you will be in control of a soldier without any equipment at a random point of the island. Along with you, dozens of bots in the same situation will also be scattered across the map. Then you have to look for crates in and out of any buildings you might encounter. In these crates you will find items that later will be used to eliminate or defend yourself from your enemies.

You may notice a timer at the top of the screen. There is a white circle on the map in which, when the counter reaches zero, a safezone (rendezvous) is created. Everyone outside this zone takes a certain amount of damage until they die. With each round the rendezvous is smaller and the damage from being out of it is greater. Between rendezvous, time is reserved for soldiers to explore the map. Therefore, you must be aware of where to go before the zone is established and, as soon as it disappears, take the opportunity to look for more resources.
